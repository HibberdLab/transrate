    <p>This page describes the ways Transrate measures an assembly.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Contig metrics</h2>

<p>Contig metrics are measures based entirely on analysing the set of contigs themselves.</p>

<p>These metrics are best used only as a quick, crude way of detecting major problems with the assembly.</p>

<p>These are informative, but are only weakly useful for judging assembly quality. For most of these metrics, we don&#39;t know what the optimum is, although we can recognise extremely bad values. For example, an extremely small (&lt;10,000) or extremely large (&gt;100,000) number of contigs is biologically implausible for most organisms, and therefore might suggest a problem with the assembly.</p>

<p>You will need to use your biological knowledge about the species you are investigating to decide what values are acceptable.</p>

<p>Transrate outputs a set of contig metrics that looks like this:</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Read mapping metrics</h2>

<p>Read mapping metrics are based on aligning the reads used in the assembly to the assembled contigs. These are a way of determining how well the assembly is supported by the original experimental evidence, and can be very useful overall quality metrics. However, they should not be considered alone, as read mapping metrics can be high for very fragmented assemblies.</p>

<p>These metrics can be useful for optimising your assembly. In particular, we want to maximise the proportion of the read pairs that map to the contigs successfully and in a biologically plausible way.</p>

<p>When you include the <code>--left</code> and <code>--right</code> options, Transrate will map the provided reads to the assembly using Bowtie2 and inspect the results. It will output something like:</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Good and bad mappings</h3>

<p>&#39;Good&#39; mappings are those aligned in a biologically plausible way, i.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>where both members are aligned</li>
<li>in the correct orientation</li>
<li>either on the same contig or...</li>
<li>within a plausible distance of the ends of two separate contigs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, &#39;bad&#39; pairs are those where one of the conditions for being &#39;good&#39; are not met.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Bridges</h3>

<p>Transrate calculates whether the read mappings contain any evidence that different contigs originate from the same transcript. These theoretical links are called bridges, and the number of bridges is shown in the <strong>supported bridges</strong> metric. A low count of supported bridges could be good or bad depending on the context. If you have a fragmented assembly, a large number of supported bridges means that scaffolding could greatly improve it. On the other hand, a large number of supported bridges in an otherwise seemingly good assembly could be indicative of misassemblies.</p>

<p>The list of supported bridges is output to a file, <code>supported_bridges.csv</code>, in case you want to make use of the information. At a later date, transrate will include the ability to scaffold the assembly using this and other information.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Comparative metrics</h2>

<p>Comparative metrics involve comparing the assembly to a related reference species. These metrics are very powerful because they are an external validation of the experimental results.</p>

<p>Usually, the closer the reference species is to the species you&#39;ve assembled, the more resolution you will have in your comparative metrics. In other words, there are likely to be more genes shared between closely related species than between distantly related species. This means that you are more likely to be able to distinguish between two assemblies of similar quality by using a closely related reference.</p>

<p>Taken with the read mapping metrics, comparative metrics allow you to optimise the quality of your assembly.</p>

<p>When you include the <code>--reference</code> option, Transrate will align each contig in your assembly to each protein in the reference using <a href="https://github.com/cboursnell/crb-blast">Conditional Reciprocal Best BLAST</a> (CRBB). CRBB-hits are high-confidence homologs.</p>

<p>CRB-BLAST starts out with bi-directional BLAST+ alignment of assembly -&gt; reference and reference -&gt; assembly. It then selects the reciprocal best hits as highest confidence and uses them to learn an appropriate e-value cutoff for each length of contig. Finally it selects all alignments with e-values below the cutoff for each length as high-confidence homologs.</p>

<p>Transrate analyses these alignments and produces output like the</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Total assembly score</h2>

<p>A total assembly score can calculated by combining the other metrics. It takes into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>proportion of the read pairs that map in a biologically plausible way</strong> (&#39;good&#39;)</li>
<li>the <strong>proportion of the reference sequences having reciprocal best hits</strong> (&#39;rhr&#39;)</li>
<li>the <strong>mean ratio of alignment length to references sequence length</strong> (&#39;ohr&#39;)</li>
</ul>

<p>The score is produced by taking the euclidean distance from the point [0, 0] of the assembly score described by the formula:</p>

<p>(**good**, <strong>rhr</strong> * <strong>ohr</strong>)</p>
