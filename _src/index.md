Transrate is software for deep inspection and quality analysis of *de-novo* transcriptome assemblies. It works by examining your assembly in detail, comparing it to experimental evidence such as the sequencing reads, and providing insight about its quality and usefulness in various situations. This can allow you to choose between assemblers and parameters, filter out the bad contigs from an assemply, and help decide when to stop trying to improve the assembly.

> NOTE: this is the documentation for transrate v1.0.0 beta3

## Overview

Transrate analyses a transcriptome assembly in three key ways:

1. by inspecting the contig sequences
2. by mapping reads to the contigs and inspecting the alignments
3. by aligning the contigs against proteins or transcripts from a related species and inspecting the alignments

**By far** the most useful metrics are those based on read mapping, in particular you should pay attention to the *Transrate score* and the individual *contig scores*.

You can read about these in detail on the [transcriptome assembly metrics](metrics.html) page.

## Installation

See [the installation guide](installation.html).

## The command-line interface

Running `transrate --help` will show you the command-line interface:

 Transrate v1.0.0.beta3
 by Richard Smith-Unna, Chris Boursnell, Rob Patro,
    Julian Hibberd, and Steve Kelly

 DESCRIPTION:
 Analyse a de-novo transcriptome assembly using three kinds of metrics:

 1. sequence-based (basic)
 2. read-mapping-based (if --left and --right are provided)
 3. reference-based (if --reference is provided)

 USAGE:
 transrate <options>

 EXAMPLES:
 # check dependencies and install any that are missing
 transrate --install-deps
 # get the transrate score for the assembly and each contig
 transrate --assembly contigs.fa --left left.fq --right right.fq
 # basic assembly metrics only
 transrate --assembly contigs.fa
 # basic and reference-based metrics with 8 threads
 transrate --assembly contigs.fa --reference Athaliana_transcripts.fa
 --threads 8
 # contig and read-based metrics for two assemblies with 32 threads
 transrate --assembly one.fa,two.fa --left l.fq --right r.fq --threads 32

 OPTIONS:
 -a, --assembly=<s>            Assembly file(s) in FASTA format,
 comma-separated
 -r, --reference=<s>           Reference proteome file in FASTA format
 -l, --left=<s>                Left reads file in FASTQ format
 -i, --right=<s>               Right reads file in FASTQ format
 -t, --threads=<i>             Number of threads to use (default: 8)
 -m, --merge-assemblies=<s>    Merge multiple assemblies into file
 -o, --outfile=<s>             Prefix filename to use for CSV output (default:
 transrate)
 -g, --loglevel=<s>            The amount of information to print. One of
 [error, info, warn, debug] (default: info)
 -n, --install-deps=<s>        Install any missing dependencies. One of [all,
 read, ref]
 -v, --version                 Print version and exit
 -h, --help                    Show this message
```
