{"name":"Transrate","tagline":"Quality assessment and comparison of transcriptome assemblies","body":"### Transrate helps you understand your transcriptome assembly\r\n\r\nTranscriptome assembly is hard. The algorithms are complex, the data is messy, and it's often not clear how to determine whether an assembly is suitable for answering a biological question.\r\n\r\nTransrate tries to help by examining your assembly in detail and providing insight about its quality and usefulness in various situations. This can allow you to choose between assemblers and parameters, and helps you decide when to stop trying to improve the assembly.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nTransrate analyses an assembly in several key ways:\r\n\r\n- by inspecting the contigs themselves\r\n- by mapping reads to the contigs and inspecting the alignments\r\n- by aligning the contigs against proteins from a related species and inspecting the alignments\r\n\r\nYou can read about these in detail on the [transcriptome assembly metrics](metrics.html) page.\r\n\r\n### The command-line interface\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Transrate v0.2.0 by Richard Smith-Unna <rds45@cam.ac.uk>\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION:\r\n  Analyse a de-novo transcriptome\r\n  assembly using three kinds of metrics:\r\n\r\n  1. contig-based\r\n  2. read-mapping (if --left and --right are provided)\r\n  3. reference-based (if --reference is provided)\r\n\r\n  Bug reports and feature requests at:\r\n  http://github.com/blahah/transrate\r\n\r\n  USAGE:\r\n  transrate <options>\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLES:\r\n  transrate --assembly contigs.fa --reference Athaliana_protein.fa --threads 8\r\n\r\n  OPTIONS:\r\n    --assembly, -a <s>:   assembly file(s) in FASTA format, comma-separated\r\n   --reference, -r <s>:   reference proteome file in FASTA format\r\n        --left, -l <s>:   left reads file in FASTQ format\r\n       --right, -i <s>:   right reads file in FASTQ format\r\n  --insertsize, -n <i>:   mean insert size (default: 200)\r\n    --insertsd, -s <i>:   insert size standard deviation (default: 50)\r\n     --threads, -t <i>:   number of threads to use (default: 8)\r\n     --outfile, -o <s>:   filename to use for CSV output (default: transate_results.csv)\r\n    --loglevel, -g <s>:   the amount of information to print. one of [error, info, warn, debug] (default: info)\r\n    --install-deps, -d:   install any missing dependencies\r\n         --profile, -p:   debug option: profile the code as it runs\r\n         --version, -v:   Print version and exit\r\n            --help, -h:   Show this message\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [getting started guide](getting_started.html) for more instructions, and see the [command-line options](cl_options.html) part of the manual for details.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nTransrate was conceived and led by Richard Smith-Unna (RSU) and written by RSU and Chris Boursnell under the guidance of [Professor Julian Hibberd](http://hibberdlab.com) at the University of Cambridge. [Steve Kelly](http://www.stevekellylab.com/) (Oxford) and [Matt MacManes](http://genomebio.org/) (University of New Hampshire) helped conceive and refine metrics.\r\n\r\nWe welcome collaboration - if you'd like help with your transcriptome project please send an email to rds45@cam.ac.uk.\r\n\r\nWe also welcome contributions to the code base - please see the [README in the Github repo](https://github.com/Blahah/transrate).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nIf you're having trouble with transrate, please first consult the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you can't find the answer to your question, you can search the [user forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transrate-users). If you still can't find the answer, please post details of your question to the user forum. If you're sure the problem you're encountering is a bug, please post it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Blahah/transrate/issues?state=open) and we'll fix it.","google":"UA-52559492-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
