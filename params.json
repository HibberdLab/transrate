{"name":"Transrate","tagline":"Quality assessment and comparison of transcriptome assemblies","body":"### Transrate helps you understand your transcriptome assembly\r\nTranscriptome assembly is hard. The algorithms are complex, the data is messy, and it's often not clear how to determine whether an assembly is suitable for answering a biological question. Transrate tries to help by examining your assembly in detail and providing insight about its quality and usefulness in various situations. This can allow you to choose between assemblers and parameters, and helps you decide when to stop trying to improve the assembly.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nTransrate analyses an assembly in several key ways:\r\n\r\n- by inspecting the contigs themselves\r\n- by mapping reads to the contigs and inspecting the alignments\r\n- by aligning the contigs against proteins from a related species and inspecting the alignments\r\n\r\nThe individual metrics will eventually be explained here.\r\n\r\n### The command-line interface\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  Transrate v0.1.0 by Richard Smith <rds45@cam.ac.uk>\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION:\r\n  Analyse a de-novo transcriptome\r\n  assembly using three kinds of metrics:\r\n\r\n  1. contig-based\r\n  2. read-mapping (if --left and --right are provided)\r\n  3. reference-based (if --reference is provided)\r\n\r\n  Bug reports and feature requests at:\r\n  http://github.com/blahah/transrate\r\n\r\n  USAGE:\r\n  transrate <options>\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLES:\r\n  transrate --assembly contigs.fa --reference Athaliana_protein.fa --threads 8\r\n\r\n  OPTIONS:\r\n    --assembly, -a <s>:   assembly file(s) in FASTA format, comma-separated\r\n   --reference, -r <s>:   reference proteome file in FASTA format\r\n        --left, -l <s>:   left reads file in FASTQ format\r\n       --right, -i <s>:   right reads file in FASTQ format\r\n  --insertsize, -n <i>:   mean insert size (default: 200)\r\n    --insertsd, -s <i>:   insert size standard deviation (default: 50)\r\n     --threads, -t <i>:   number of threads to use (default: 8)\r\n     --outfile, -o <s>:   filename to use for CSV output (default: transate_results.csv)\r\n           --quiet, -q:   don't print results - only save to file\r\n         --profile, -p:   debug option: profile the code as it runs\r\n         --version, -v:   Print version and exit\r\n            --help, -h:   Show this message\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTransrate was conceived and led by Richard Smith-Unna (RSU) and written by RSU and Chris Boursnell under the guidance of Professor Julian Hibberd at the University of Cambridge. Steve Kelly (Oxford) and Matt MacManes (University of New Hampshire) helped conceive and refine metrics.\r\n\r\nWe welcome collaboration - if you'd like help with your transcriptome project please send an email: rds45@cam.ac.uk.
