# Transrate website

This is the website for [Transrate](http://github.com/Blahah/transrate), served at http://hibberdlab.com/transrate.

The site is written in Markdown and converted to HTML using Jekyll.

To make updates to the content, edit the `.md` files in the `/_src/` directory. When you've finished making updates, `git commit` them, and then run `_src/_scripts/build` to push the changed up to Github Pages.

Note that trying to push changes when you don't have permission will fail.
